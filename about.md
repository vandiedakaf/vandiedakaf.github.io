# About Me

My name is Francois du Toit and I'm a software developer &amp; software architect.

When solving a problem I like to create a solution that is easy to consume; both in terms of concept and technicality. The kind of solution that makes it seem like the problem was never difficult to start with. A solution that the average developer would not look at twice but one that a kindred problem solver will appreciate.

<!--You can find some of my solutions (hopefully simple ones) on my GitHub account {% include icon-github.html username="vandiedakaf" %}-->

# About the Blog

In order to host this blog I'm making use of [GitHub Pages][github-pages] which is powered by [Jekyll][jekyll]. That means that this site is hosted directly from my GitHub repository.
 
# About the Logo

The Afrikaans translation of my French family name is "van die dak af" which means "from the roof". Our family crest comprises a roof with three birds. I searched for triangles (to represent the roof) and found this [image][triangle], created by Jonathan Li, at the [Noun Project][nounproject]. I modified the triangle to fit my needs; this entailed adding three dots to denote the birds and rotating the triangle so that the opening symbolises a chimney. After all that it reminds me of a lab flask.

Bugs, enhancements and questions can be submitted at the GitHub repository [issues][github-issues] page.
